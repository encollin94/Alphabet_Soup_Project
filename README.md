# Alphabet Soup
## Overview of the analysis  
Preprocessing data for a neural network model based on a data csv file. Create, evaluate and optimize the model for processing the csv. Different Software used include jupyter notebook.   

## Results
Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model? targets include the applicant_types, and ask amount
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model? features include binary outoput of successful or unsuccessful
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data? both the name and ein were dropeed
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why? three layers for a very basic model. i wanted a basic simple model
Were you able to achieve the target model performance? accuracy was  about 51.4 percent after it was run, so not very accurate at all. 
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance? I would just add more layers 

## Summary  
This was to use several different data to see if an application would be successful at Alphabet Soup.
